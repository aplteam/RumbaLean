# ETag

Applies to:{.prefix}

Response{.info}

The ETag property is a simple string that Rumba will use as a value for the ETag header in the
response. It must be double quoted. For example:

~~~
r.ETag←'"abc1"'
~~~

To provide a weak ETag you must double quote the string, and then prefix with W/.For example:

~~~
r.ETag←'W/"abc1"'
~~~

If the property is an empty string (the default), Rumba will not include an ETag header in the
composed response.
