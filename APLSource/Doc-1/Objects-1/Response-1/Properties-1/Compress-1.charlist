# Compress

Applies to:{.prefix}

Response{.info}

The Compress property specifies whether or not Rumba should attempt to apply content encoding. Its
default value is 1. It should be set to 0 for content that is natively compressed. 

In addition, small responses may not benefit from compression. Compression will only occur if 
Compress is set to 1, AND Rumba and the client can agree on a compression type. Rumba only 
supports gzip at this time.
