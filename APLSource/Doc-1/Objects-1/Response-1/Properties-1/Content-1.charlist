# Content

Applies to:{.prefix}

Response{.info}

The Content property is a simple character vector of content, if any, to be returned in the
message. It may also be set to an HTMLDocument object, which Rumba will compose before sending.
Its default value is an empty character vector. If the →[Chunked] property is set to 1, then the
content property should not be set; in this case the →[##.Methods.PutChunk] method should be used
to provide content.
