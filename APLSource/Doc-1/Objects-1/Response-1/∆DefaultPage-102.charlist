# Response Object

The Response object is a server-side object that represents an HTTP response that the server will
send back to the client.

A response object is created using the static →[Methods.NewResponse] method. The result of the
→[##.Server.Properties.OnRequest] call back function must be a response object. It is the
responsibility of this call back function to create a response object, specify its properties
appropriately and return it as the result.
