# OnRequest Property

Applies to:{.prefix}

Server{.info}

The OnRequest property specifies a call back function to be called on each request to the server.

This function is expected to exist in the namespace or object instance defined by the →[Context]
property. This callback may be the name of a method of some class.

The right argument to the function is a →[##.##.Message] object provided by the server. The result
of the callback must be a →[##.##.Response] object.
