# CongaTimeout Property

Applies to:{.prefix}

Server{.info}

The CongaTimeout property specifies the number of milliseconds at which the Conga wait should
timeout and the server should perform housekeeping. The default value is 5000 (5 seconds).

At each timeout, in addition to Rumba's built-in housekeeping,  Rumba executes the
â†’[OnCongaTimeout] callback. This function may do additional, application specific housekeeping.
