# Server Object

The server object represents a server.

A server object is created using the static →[Methods.NewServer] method. Various properties may
then be specified. The →[Properties.OnRequest] property specifies the function to be called for
each request received by the server. The →[Methods.Start] method starts up the server, listening
on the specified port.
