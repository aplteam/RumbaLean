# GZip

Applies to:{.prefix}

Message{.info}

The GZip property is a boolean indicating that the message body was 
compressed by the sender, and thus the →[Content] property is
compressed. It is equivalent to inspecting
the Content-Encoding header for 'gzip'.

The →[*.GetUncompressedContent] method returns the uncompressed content. 

The DecodeGzip function may also be used to uncompress the data.
