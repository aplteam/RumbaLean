Message{.info}

The ContentLength property is an integer containing the value of the Content-Length header.
However, if the Buffer property for the connection or client is 1, and the message is chunked,
then the ContentLength contains the total length of all of the chunks processed at any given
moment. If the Content-Length header is not provided, ContentLength is 0.
