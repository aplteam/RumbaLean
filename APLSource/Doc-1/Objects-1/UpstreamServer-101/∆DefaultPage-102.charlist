# UpstreamServer Object

The server object represents an upstream server.

An UpStreamServer object is created using the static 竊端Methods.NewUpstreamServer] method. The
竊端Properties.Host] property specifies the IP address of the upstream server. The
竊端Properties.Port] property specifies the port number of the upstream server.

One or more UpstreamServer objects are created and assigned to the
竊端##.Server.Properties.UpstreamServers] property to define the roll of the server.
