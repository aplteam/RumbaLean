# Request Object

The Request object is a client-side object that represents an HTTP request to be sent to a server.

A new request is created using the static →[Methods.NewRequest] method. Various properties are then
specified, and the request is sent to the server using the →[##.Client.Methods.Send] method of the
client object.
