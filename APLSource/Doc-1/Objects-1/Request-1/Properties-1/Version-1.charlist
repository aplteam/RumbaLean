# Version

Applies to:{.prefix}

Request{.info}

This property specifies the HTTP version of the request. Normally the value for this property is
supplied by the Client object. 

It should only be specified here in the Request object if a
persistent connection is switching protocols mid-stream. It defaults to an empty string which
indicates that Client.Version should be used which in turn defaults to "HTTP/1.1"
