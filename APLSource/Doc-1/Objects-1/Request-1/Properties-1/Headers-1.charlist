# Headers

Applies to:{.prefix}

Request{.info}

This property specifies the header names and values to be sent with the request. Headers is a
vector of two-item vectors, where each item is the name and value of a header. The Host and
Content-Length headers should not be provided here; Rumba adds these by default.

The Content-Encoding header should not be provided if â†’[Compress] is set to 1.

If not provided in the Headers property, the "Accept" header defaults to "\\*/\\*".
