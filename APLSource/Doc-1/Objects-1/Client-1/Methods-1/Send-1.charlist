X is a Client, Y is a Request, R is 0. The Send method sends a request to the server. It does not
wait for a response. Use the →[Receive] method to wait for a response. To pipeline requests, Send
may be called repeatedly without intervening calls to Receive. Eventually, Receive should be
called as many times as Send, in order to receive all of the responses.
