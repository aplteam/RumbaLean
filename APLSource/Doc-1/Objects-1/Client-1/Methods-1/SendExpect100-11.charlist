Sends a message with an "Expect" "100-continue" header.

X is a Client, Y is a Request, R is a Message. Note that unlike Send, this method waits for the
response message from the server. Note further that SendExpect100 will signal an error if there
are any outstanding (unreceived) messages on the client. These two behaviors together prevent
pipelining of messages with Expect 100-continue headers.
